input: one or many files

in-file input separator: \n

output: 3 .txt files: floats, integers, strings

output location: program's directory

options:
-o: sets path for output
-p: sets prefix for output files' names
-a: append instead of rewrite on collision output
-s: short statistics (how much were written in every file)
-f: full statistics (max and min nums, avg num, longest and shortest string)

default output collision behaviour: rewrite

stats output: console
no *crashes*
if process failed, state a reason
partial completion preferred over stop -> should write at instance, spare the RAM


first write depending on key
All others append only

define type
call a func to write?
